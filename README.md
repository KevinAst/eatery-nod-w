# eatery-nod-w

## Overview

**eatery-nod-w** is **Date Night Restaurant Selector** ... a web-app
**that randomly selects a "date night" restaurant from a pool of
favorites**.  In other words, it gives a **nod** to an **eatery**
(_geeks need to have fun somehow_ :-)

My wife and I have a steady "date night" (with another couple) and we
are always indecisive on which of our favorite restaurants to
frequent, so **eatery-nod-w** provides the spinning wheel!

**eatery-nod-w** is a web-based [PWA] rendition of the [eatery-nod]
**react-native expo mobile app**.

## Running the App

If you wish to play with **eatery-nod-w**, simply run it from it's
deployed production site: https://eatery-nod-w.js.org/

Currently the sign-in process has **"locked down" account creation**,
because of the limited resources of the free Google Firebase account.
However you can **use a "Guest ID"** that will morph the environment
into your own "mocked" in-memory data source (that doesn't utilize
Firebase).

<ul> <!--- indentation hack --->

Simply use an email id that begins with `guestNO@` (ex:
`@guestNO@myDomain.com`), with a password of `guestNO`.

</ul>

When using a "Guest ID", remember the following:
- Your GPS location will be morphed to New Orleans.
- Your Eateries pool is morphed into an in-memory DB.
- Your Discovery view is live, searching real eateries in New Orleans.
- You can add entries to your pool (from the discovery view), but
  remember that your pool is an in-memory DB ... so if you refresh the site,
  it will revert back to the initial in-memory DB image.

## Eatery Pool

The main screen of eatery-nod is the **Eatery Pool** (_please refer to
the [eateries feature](src/features/eateries)_).

This visualizes your persistent pool of restaurants to select from
(the list can optionally be filtered).

You can select a restaurant directly, or "spin" for a random
selection.

The "detailed" view provides direct communication to the establishment
(phone them, visit their web site, or navigate to their address).

## Discovery

Your pool of eateries is maintained through **Discovery** (_please
refer to the [discovery feature](src/features/discovery)_).

You don't have to maintain the details of your pool by hand.  Rather,
you simply search the restaurants using the **discovery** feature.
This is the same source that is used when you issue a Google Search
(based on [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/)).

Within the discovery view, you simply toggle the check next to the
entry.  **Red** entries are in your pool, **Grey** entries are not.

## Authorization

Authorization is provided through the [auth
feature](src/features/common/auth), requiring a validated email/password
before promoting any application screens.

## Technical

The technical details about the **eatery-nod-w** application can be
found here.

**eatery-nod-w** is a web-based [PWA] rendition of the [eatery-nod]
**react-native expo mobile app**.


## Feature Based Development

The implementation of **eatery-nod-w** employs **features** through a
utility called **[feature-u]**, that facilitates **feature-based
solutions**, making it's features truly **plug-and-play**!

**Feature Based Development** greatly improves code comprehension,
because there is a direct correlation between the **problem space**
_(or requirements)_ and the **implementation** _(the code)_!

This approach scales better, making the code easier to maintain,
because the modules _(or features)_ are smaller and more focused.
When features are **plug-and-play**, the application is in essence
broken up into several mini-apps _(so to speak)_.

Here is a complete list of [**eatery-nod-w**
features](src/features/README.md).

You can find more information about **[feature-u]** here:
