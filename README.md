# eatery-nod-w

A Date Night Restaurant Selector ... _randomly selecting a "date
night" restaurant from a pool of favorites_.

My wife and I have a steady "date night" (with another couple) and we
are always indecisive on which of our favorite restaurants to
frequent, so eatery-nod provides the spinning wheel (i.e. it gives a
"nod" to an "eatery")!

This project is a web-based
[PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)-ish
rendition of the [eatery-nod](https://github.com/KevinAst/eatery-nod)
react-native expo mobile app.
