# googlePlacesApiKey.js

The `googlePlacesApiKey.js` is gitignored, preventing unauthorized
access from github check-in.

You should supply this file, with **your** google credentials.

It is also recommended that you encode this resource (optionally) to minimize
exposure to your deployment the site!

**googlePlacesApiKey.js**
```js
export default 'tbd';
```
